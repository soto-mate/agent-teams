# Adopting agent-teams

Give this file to a desktop agent. The agent prepares the machinery. A human handles every
credential.

## Verify the clone

Clone the public repository. Create the runtime environment and install the one external
Python package:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install zulip
```

Before adding personas or config, run every offline selftest:

```sh
for module in scripts/*.py; do .venv/bin/python "$module" --selftest || exit 1; done
```

Stop on any failure. An untouched clone is expected to pass with no environment variables.

## Create the fleet

Copy the starters, keep `operator.md` and `bridge.md`, and choose two or three persona
files to begin:

```sh
cp agents.examples/*.md .agents/agents/
```

The starters are skeletons, not this fleet's live agent files. Each carries the bare shape of
a role; the running estate's judgment lives in its own `.agents/agents/` and `memory/`, which the
public repository never ships. Read a starter as a beginning to rewrite, never as a mirror to
keep in step with whatever this estate's seats do next.

Rename and rewrite the chosen personas. Keep each filename, its frontmatter `name`, and the
persona matrix keys identical: the matrix is the roster, and `scripts/personas.py` reads it.
Remove unused starter rows.

Create the live, gitignored config files and edit them:

```sh
for f in config/*.example.json; do cp "$f" "${f%.example.json}.json"; done
```

Each persona's matrix row selects its harness: `claude` runs Claude Code, `codex` runs Codex,
`agy` runs agy, and `opencode` runs OpenCode. Install and log in only to the CLIs named by
the live matrix.

Optional browser tools start from `mcps/playwright.example.json`; copy it to the gitignored
`mcps/playwright.json` and edit it for the local install. That one definition serves Claude,
Codex, agy, and OpenCode wakes.

Installed agy versions that do not read workspace MCP files need their global path linked to
that same definition. The command fails safely if the path already holds another configuration:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/config
ln -s "$(pwd -P)/mcps/playwright.json" ~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json
```

`config/domains.json` ships empty and stays empty until a channel of yours fronts a repo. Fill it
with `"<channel name>": "/absolute/path"` and every wake in that channel is told where that repo
is and that its skills apply, read by path. `docs/OPERATING.md` has the rest, including where a
domain's board lives.

Copy `docs/OPERATING.example.md` to the gitignored `docs/OPERATING.md`: the live file is your
estate's, kept in the private overlay, and the example is only its skeleton. Fill it in section
by section as your fleet teaches you.

## Create the private overlay

`memory/`, `plans/`, and `.agents/agents/` are ignored by the public repository. `commit.py` refuses
personal paths until a private overlay exists. The human creates or chooses a private Git
remote and supplies its URL. The agent may then run:

```sh
mkdir -p .private memory plans .agents/agents
git init --bare .private/.git
git --git-dir=.private/.git --work-tree=. config core.bare false
git --git-dir=.private/.git --work-tree=. config status.showUntrackedFiles no
git --git-dir=.private/.git --work-tree=. config user.name "Agent Team"
git --git-dir=.private/.git --work-tree=. config user.email "agent-team@localhost"
git --git-dir=.private/.git --work-tree=. remote add origin "$PRIVATE_REPO_URL"
git --git-dir=.private/.git --work-tree=. add -f -- memory plans .agents/agents
git --git-dir=.private/.git --work-tree=. commit -m "Seed private overlay"
git --git-dir=.private/.git --work-tree=. branch -M private-overlay
git --git-dir=.private/.git --work-tree=. push -u origin private-overlay
```

The remote may retain an archival `main`; the overlay uses `private-overlay`. Verify the
split before continuing:

```sh
git status --short
git --git-dir=.private/.git --work-tree=. status --short
```

## Protect the public repository

The human's seat, not an agent's: repository settings are capability grants, and a wake does
not grant itself capabilities even where `gh` is authenticated with admin. Skip this and the
landing ritual is advisory: with nothing required, `gh pr merge --auto` merges on the spot,
before the checks run.

In the fork's GitHub settings, allow auto-merge and restrict merges to rebase. Then protect
`main` with the required status check `selftests`, the job key from the selftests workflow
rather than its file name; enforce it for admins, require zero approvals, leave force pushes
off, and do not require branches to be up to date, which would stall auto-merge whenever two
land at once. Make `gh` resolve on the PATH a wake inherits, which on a Homebrew Mac means
linking `/opt/homebrew/bin/gh` into `~/.local/bin`: a wake's PATH carries the latter and not
the former.

Read the settings back rather than trusting the clicks:

```sh
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo> --jq '{auto: .allow_auto_merge, rebase: .allow_rebase_merge}'
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/branches/main/protection \
  --jq '{checks: .required_status_checks.contexts, admins: .enforce_admins.enabled}'
```

## Prepare the runtime

Create `~/.config/agent-team/` with `logs/` and `state/`. Put `bridge.zuliprc` there, plus
one `<persona>.zuliprc` for each persona. Put `AGENT_TEAM_MATE_EMAIL` in
`~/.config/agent-team/.env`. Set path overrides there only when the defaults do not match
the machine: `AGENT_TEAM_CONFIG_DIR`, `AGENT_TEAM_STATE_DIR`, `AGENT_TEAM_LOGS_DIR`,
`AGENT_TEAM_MEMORY_DIR`, `CLAUDE_BIN`, `CODEX_BIN`, `AGY_BIN`, or `OPENCODE_BIN`.
An install retaining a nondefault launchd label also sets `AGENT_TEAM_LAUNCHD_LABEL` there.
`BRIDGE_IDENTITY` renames the bridge seat inside the scripts only: an estate that sets it also
renames `.agents/agents/bridge.md`, its zuliprc and its Zulip bot to match.

Render the launchd template from the repository root into `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, naming the
file after the label (`AGENT_TEAM_LAUNCHD_LABEL` if the install sets one):

```sh
repo_dir=$(pwd -P)
sed -e "s|__HOME__|$HOME|g" -e "s|__REPO_DIR__|$repo_dir|g" \
  launchd/com.agent-team.plist.example > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agent-team.plist
```

That directory is the only one launchd reloads at login, so a reboot brings the fleet back by
itself. Nothing renders into the repository: a job bootstrapped from any other path is
registered for one boot session only. `scripts/restart.sh` loads the job from there and
restarts it.

The human now creates the Zulip organization and one bot per persona, downloads each
zuliprc, installs every selected harness CLI, and logs in to those CLIs. An agent must not
read, create, copy, or edit credentials.

Run all selftests again. Start only through `scripts/restart.sh`. In Zulip, mention one
persona in a topic. Adoption is complete when that persona wakes, works, and replies there.

## Cut over an existing fleet

Cutover is a desktop operation after the export gate passes. Back up the old root, clone the
public repository into a new folder, and copy only these private surfaces from the old root:
`memory/`, `plans/`, `.agents/agents/`, `mcps/playwright.json`, and the live `config/*.json`
files. Run the private-overlay bootstrap above with the archived private repository as its
remote. Its existing `main` remains the old estate history; new personal commits use
`private-overlay`.

Render and load the launchd template from the new root. If the installed job retains its old
label, render that label into the plist, put the same value in
`AGENT_TEAM_LAUNCHD_LABEL`, and pass it to the first restart. Start only with
`scripts/restart.sh`. After one smoke wake, verify that public `git status` is clean and that
the overlay log contains the copied personal files:

```sh
git status --short
git --git-dir=.private/.git --work-tree=. log -1 --stat
```
