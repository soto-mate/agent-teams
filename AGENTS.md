# Agent-team (Zulip persona fleet)

The Zulip fleet: the personas in the persona matrix plus the bridge identity, woken by @-mentions
through scripts/listener.py.

Zulip working rules and the permissions ledger live in docs/OPERATING.md.

The word is persona, in code and prose. No em-dashes anywhere. Minimal, clean, terse:
comments earn their lines, and a file the operator cannot read end to end is too long.

Secrets live in ~/.config/agent-team/ and never in this repo. Token and .env work is
the operator's, always. Never print or log a zuliprc's contents. A wake does not grant itself
capabilities.

Personal content lives only in `memory/`, `plans/`, `.agents/agents/`, and gitignored config.
Machinery runs unmodified in any estate: persona names, channel names, models, and absolute
paths live in the config JSONs, never in `scripts/`; a change that needs an estate value in a
shared file moves the value to config first.

Persona memory lives only under `memory/<persona>/` by absolute path; write durable judgment
only and fetch current state fresh.

Wakes: a mention wakes a persona; the record it sees is a delta since its lane's last wake;
a topic is an open session, resolving it ends the session, reopening starts fresh; status
topics are the exception, they are never resolved. The flags -opus -sonnet -low -mid -high
-xtra -claude -codex -agy -opencode parse only off configured flag holders.
A persona mention wakes that persona once; a persona-triggered wake and any wake in a loop topic
post with mentions stripped; mid-wake asks go through `send.py --ask` and `read.py --wait`.
A wake that finds its resource held by another wake reports blocked and ends; it never sleeps
on it; it kills only pids it started.

Loops: header before kick one; `loops.py kick` fires kick one so the ledger row lands
before the post; every kick ends "kick n/N" and mentions its persona; the budget floor is
atomic; the operator continuation answers with one KICK or CLOSE line and anything
else is discarded unread.

Every string the machinery posts or injects lives in scripts/prompts.py; tunables in
scripts/constants.py. Persona, harness, model-effort, operator-rail and channel defaults live
in the JSON files under config/, rails.json holding both rails and the digest sweep's seat;
copy each tracked `.example.json` to its gitignored live name on first setup.
Every effort in those files uses low/mid/high/xtra. A posted string literal anywhere else is
a bug. Every module carries --selftest, offline; bodies live in `scripts/tests/`; a test body
imports what it uses; a case table changes in the same commit as its organ.

Fleet skills live in `.agents/skills/`, one directory each with a `SKILL.md`; personas live in
`.agents/agents/`. Claude Code discovers them through the symlinks `.claude/skills` and
`.claude/agents`; Codex, OpenCode and agy read `.agents/` natively. Nothing under `.codex/`:
Codex reads `.agents/skills`, and
its subagent format is TOML, not our Markdown.

Subagents: name the model on every one you spawn, because unnamed means inherited and a
silent spawn from an expensive wake spends that model on file reading. The cheap tier is the
default: reading, searching, summarizing, verifying, probing and source collection are cheap-tier
work. Escalate only when the subagent's output ships as-is rather than reworked by you, with
the reason in the briefing as one line, and never spawn one on the scarcest tier. On Claude
that reads sonnet by default, opus to escalate, and never fable.

scripts/restart.sh is the only restart path: a bare kickstart can kill a wake mid-run.

Main takes no direct pushes, the operator included. Personal content in the private repo
is the exception; commit.py pushes it directly, and commit.py refuses a public path.

Private-repo git mutations run only through `python3 scripts/commit.py -m "message"
<path>...`: name every path, never use `git stash`, and never substitute raw git if its bounded
lock wait fails. Report named files left written but uncommitted. Read-only git and worktree git
stay outside this ritual.

How changes land is in `.agents/skills/devops` of the repo you are landing in. Read it before the
first commit. A repo without one: open a PR and stop.

## Taste

The taste here is zen in the Sōtō sense: plain, spare, nothing extra. Simplicity
outranks precision, and a deletion is a contribution. This is an aesthetic, not a
vocabulary: no koans, no Buddhist terms in work product.

Substantive batches run the verification loop: a builder lands, a reviewer persona reads the
diffs against the brief and an evaluator gates from outside in parallel, findings earn one
scoped round, then a re-check of only the fixes. Plans end with their load-bearing unknowns
named. A plan that sets
a rule names the rule's delivery mechanism (WAKE_HEADER, AGENTS.md, a persona file, or
docs/OPERATING.md plus who fetches it); text in a file no wake loads is dead text.

A feature runs in one topic in #setup, design through build to verification: terms of
record, the builder's kick, and the verification reports all land where the design lives.
Domain channels carry plans and discussion, never batch execution. #workbench is archived,
history intact.

This file stays lean on purpose (Mate, 2026-08-12): rules about Zulip get written down
after Zulip teaches them, not before; seed rules that start a habit are the exception
(Mate, 2026-08-12).
